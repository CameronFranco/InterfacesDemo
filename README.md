# Interfaces Demo!

In class we talked about how interfaces were a way to do inheritance between classes.

This repo has several commits:
*  Initial Commit - Sets up the repository for use with Visual Studio and creates the skeleton of a C# Command line application. __NOT UNITY__
*  Add IEquitable Interface - Creates the interface we're going to use to compare our objects
*  Add Cars - Creates the Car class and shows how it's used in Program.cs
*  Add Monsters - Creates the Monster class and shows how it's used in Program.cs
